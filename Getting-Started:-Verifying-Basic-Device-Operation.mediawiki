This guide shows how to exercise some very basic device operations using the [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/tree/master/host/utilities/bladeRF-cli bladeRF-cli] program in order to verify that the device is functioning and that the required host software is installed.

This guide shows invocations and prompts from a Linux system. Windows users may simply replace <code>bladeRF-cli</code> invocations with <code>bladeRF-cli.exe</code> and use the same commands.

If you encounter errors, warnings, or unexpected output, be sure to check the [[Troubleshooting]] page.

= Detecting the bladeRF =
First, take a look at bladeRF-cli's command-line options, via <code>bladeRF-cli --help</code>.

Note that the ''-p'' option may be used to probe for device. Plug in your device, and run the following command. You should see similar output.

<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -p
    Backend:        libusb
    Serial:         f12ce1037830a1b27f3ceeba1f521413
    USB Bus:        4
    USB Address:    8
</pre>

= Querying device information =

More information about the attached device can be viewed while running <code>bladeRF-cli</code> in interactive mode, 
Enter this mode and issue the <code>help</code> command to see a list of available commands.

Use the <code>info</code> command to print information about the device, and <code>version</code> to view version information, most notably, the firmware:

<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -i

bladeRF> help

... (Help text shown here ) ...

bladeRF> info

bladeRF> version
  bladeRF-cli version:        0.11.0-git-58c3ff4
  libbladeRF version:         0.16.1-git-58c3ff4

  Firmware version:           1.7.1-git-ca697ee
  FPGA version:               Unknown (FPGA not loaded)
</pre>

Here we see the device's serial number, the VCTCXO DAC calibration value, FPGA information, and USB connection information.  Take note of the FPGA size, as this will help determine which FPGA file to load.

Note that this information could have also been gathered using multiple <code>-e <command></code> argument: 
<code>bladeRF-cli -e version -e info</code>

Before going further, the devices FPGA must be configured.

= Loading the FPGA =

FPGA images can be obtained from [[the Nuand website|http://www.nuand.com/fpga]] or from a [[nightly build of "bleeding edge" images|http://hoopycat.com/bladerf_builds/]].

To load an image from the command line: 
<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -l <path/to/fpga/file>
</pre>

Or to load an image while in interactive mode:
<pre>
bladeRF> load fpga <path/to/fpga/file>
</pre>

After the FPGA loads, you should see LED1, LED2 and LED3 light up. When is in use, LED2 will be blinking.

If you do not want to manually load the FPGA at every power on, see the [[FPGA Autoloading]] page.
