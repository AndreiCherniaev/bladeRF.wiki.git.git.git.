= Download and extract the latest release =
Fetch the latest release from the official site. This is always named '''libtecla.tar.gz'''.

<pre>
wget http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/libtecla.tar.gz
</pre>

Extract the tarball to the current directory. A ''libtecla/'' directory will be extracted.

<pre>
tar xzf libtecla.tar.gz
</pre>

= Configure and build =

By default, libtecla will install into <code>/usr/local</code>.  If you wish to install the library elsewhere, add <code>--prefix=<desired location></code> to the following ''configure'' command.

Configure the build via: <code>CC=gcc ./configure</code> or <code>CC=clang ./configure</code>, depending upon which compiler you'd like to use.

'''Note:''' On OS X 10.9 (XCode 5.0), the following was required after ''configure'' generated a Makefile, because the build was attempting to link against a non-existent libgcc.a.  If you see this build failure, try simply removing libgcc.a from the build. (Everyone else can ignore this bit.)
<pre>
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
cat Makefile.bak | sed -e 's/libgcc.a//g' > Makefile
</pre>

Build with <code>make</code>

= Install =
<pre>sudo make install</pre>
