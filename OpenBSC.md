## Tasks
* Identifying and summarizing the interface by which the bladeRF would have to present itself
* Identifying what the aforementioned interface requires that the current bladeRF support lacks?
* Identifying if certain functions need to be implemented in the FPGA? (e.g., mod/demod, filters, etc.)
