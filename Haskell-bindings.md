# Haskell Function Programming bindings for the BladeRF board

A monadic structured fat bindings to the underlining libbladeRF C library is being worked
here [hlibBladeRF](https://github.com/victoredwardocallaghan/hlibBladeRF).

Most of the C functions have been binded however only a few have been wrapped up in the
BladeRF monad so far. Some example programs are provided.

As soon as I have wrapped up most of the functions into the BladeRF monad I shall publish
the first version to the Haskell Hackage repository. I remark the work here to avoid
duplicated work and increase possible collaboration and interest early on.

Feel free to get back to me with questions and feedback, pull requests welcome!
