This page serves as a place to document notes and developments in building libbladeRF for Android, which has spun off from discussions in [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/issues/386 issue #386]. It is expected that notes documented here will yield fine-grained tasks and patches that may be submitted to the [https://www.github.com/nuand/bladeRF/issues issue tracker].

= Android NDK =
The preferred approach for libbladeRF support on Android is via the [https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html Android NDK].  We would rathermaintain a single codebase that is portable, rather than introduce a Java reimplementation.

= Toolchain files and build scripts =

Below is a list of some reference CMake toolchain setups and build scripts
* [https://github.com/mambrus/mixedmisc/tree/master/posixtest_android mambrus's posix test]
* [https://goo.gl/yfUatK jettero's build script]


= pthread_cancel() =
<code>pthread_cancel()</code> does not exist in Android. This is used in the libbladeRF code base as a "last ditch effort" if an attempt to join a thread times out. We will need to be able to remove this at compile time.  One approach will be to add a <code>BLADERF_OS_ANDROID</code> definition and add the following to thread.h:

<pre>
#ifdef BLADERF_OS_ANDROID
#    define THREAD_CANCEL(thread) do {} while (0)
#else
#    define THREAD_CANCEL(thread) pthread_cancel(thread)
#endif
</pre>
