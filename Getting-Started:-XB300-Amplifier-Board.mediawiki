= Overview = 

The [https://www.nuand.com/blog/product/amplifier/ Nuand XB&#8209;300] is an amplifier expansion card that greatly increases the range of the bladeRF. On the receive side, the XB&#8209;300 features a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a combiner for antenna diversity. The transmit side features a Power Amplifier (PA), TRX switch, and a highly accurate ADC for measuring output power of the PA. The schematic for the XB&#8209;300 [https://nuand.com/xb300.pdf is available here].

The [http://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/TSS-53LNB+.pdf TSS&#8209;53LNB wideband (0.5-5&nbsp;GHz) LNA] found in the RX path provides a low noise figure and a maximum gain of 20&nbsp;dB.

The [http://www.skyworksinc.com/uploads/documents/SE2623L_202397E.pdf SE2623L PA] in the TX path offers up to 33&nbsp;dBm of gain in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM band. It features an integrated temperature-compensated power detector.

The XB-300 ships in a configuration designed for separate RX and TX paths. Thus, if you are using
an XB-300 in its "out of the box" state, follow the <b>RX</b> and <b>TX</b> instructions below.

The population of resistors <code>R8</code>, <code>R10</code>, and <code>R23</code> select the input to the RX LNA. Users may adjust the resistor options to instead use a single antenna and the on-board TRX switch, or add an additional RX antenna input to a combiner for diversity.

= Hardware Configuration =

== RX ==

# Connect the bladeRF <b>RX</b> SMA connector (<i>J53</i>) to the XB-300 <b>RXIF</b> SMA (<i>J7</i>) with an SMA cable.
# Connect a cable or antenna to the XB-300 <b>RX ANT</b> SMA connector (<i>J5</i>).

== TX ==

# Connect the bladeRF <b>TX</b> SMA connector (<i>J54</i>) to the XB-300 <b>TXIF</b> SMA (<i>J4</i>) with an SMA cable.
# Connect a cable or antenna to the XB-300 <b>TRX ANT</b> SMA connector (<i>J3</i>).

== TRX ==

Follow the above instructions for <b>TX</b>

== Example Connection ==

The following demonstrates the SMA and antenna connections when using one RX antenna and one TX antenna. This is the default, as-shipped, configuration.

= Usage =

The general steps for using the XB-300 are as follows:

# Enable the board. This configures and initializes the expansion port GPIOs.
# Enable the LNA and/or PA.

== libbladeRF ==

Enable the XB-300:

```
int status = bladerf_expansion_attach(device_handle, BLADERF_XB_300);
```


Enable the the LNA or PA:

```
bladerf_xb300_amplifier amp = BLADERF_XB300_AMP_LNA; /* Or BLADERF_XB300_AMP_PA */
bool enable = true;
int status = bladerf_xb300_set_amplifier_enable(device_handle, amp, enable);
```

For users that have performed the TRX resistor modification, the TRX switch can be configured as follows:

```
bladerf_xb300_trx trx = BLADERF_XB300_TRX_RX; /* Or BLADERF_XB300_TRX_TX */
int status = bladerf_xb300_set_trx(state->dev, trx);
```

== bladeRF-cli ==

The below snippet lists the commands needed to enable the XB-300, turn on the
TX PA, and to turn on the RX LNA:

```
bladeRF> xb 300 enable

  Enabling XB-300 Amplifier board
  XB-300 Amplifier board successfully enabled

bladeRF> xb 300 pa on

  PA: Enabled

bladeRF> xb 300 lna on

  LNA: Enabled
```

For users that have performed the TRX resistor modification, the TRX switch can be configure as followed:

```
# Set switch to TX
bladeRF> xb 300 trx tx

# Set switch to RX
bladeRF> xb 300 trx rx
```

== Recommendations ==

An [https://www.nuand.com/blog/product/power-supply/ external DC power supply] is highly recommended when using the XB-300. See [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/wiki/bladeRF-Accessories#bladerf-jumper-configuration this page] for instructions on how to power the bladeRF from an external DC supply instead of the USB connection.

When using the TX PA, additional external filtering for the band/channel of interest is also <b>highly</b> recommended. The connectorized filters provided by [https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/Filters.html Mini-Circuits] are a great option, but there are many other vendors and options available.
