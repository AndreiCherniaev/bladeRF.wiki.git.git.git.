=== External DC Power ===
The DC barrel jack on the bladeRF requires a 5V adapter, which should be rated to supply 1.5 to 2A.

The inner plug on the receptacle (on the bladeRF) is 2.5 mm and is +V.  The diameter of the plug on the power supply is 5.5mm and is -V.

As shown by page 14 on the [http://nuand.com/bladerf.pdf bladeRF schematic], the DC barrel jack is a  [http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/393/rapc712x_cd-371318.pdf Switchcraft RAPC712X]. Remember that both jumpers on J70 need to be moved when switching between USB power and the DC barrel input.
