= Coverity =

[https://scan.coverity.com/ Coverity] does not allow for public access to defect lists.  However, it does allow project maintainers to grant registered Coverity users ''Contributor/Member'', ''Contributer/Viewer'', and ''Other/Observer'' permissions.  You're more than welcome to the bladeRF Coverity scan results, all you have to do is ask! :)

== Setup ==

# Download Coverity Scan from https://scan.coverity.com/download
# Extract and add the Coverity Scan tools to the path
# Add the FX3 compiler to the Coverity configuration
## `cov-configure --comptype gcc --compiler /opt/cypress/fx3_sdk/arm-2011.03/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc`
## Replace /opt/cypress/fx3_sdk/arm-2011.03/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc with wherever your FX3 SDK is installed

== Performing a build ==

Always use the root level CMakeLists.txt to do a build, not the one in host.  If you do a build in host, the fx3 sources will be removed from Coverity.

=== Setup common CMake build folder (if needed) ===
# cd to root of source tree (e.g. cd ~/bladeRF)
# `mkdir build`
# `cd build`
# `cmake ..`

=== Perform the Coverity build ===
# cd to root build folder (e.g. cd ~/bladeRF/build)
# `make clean`
# `rm -rf cov-int`
# `cov-build --dir cov-int make`
# `tar -czvf bladeRF.tgz cov-int/`
# The tarball can be manually submitted to the website, or you can automatically submit it via
