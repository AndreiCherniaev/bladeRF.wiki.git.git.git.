= Backing up and restoring calibration data =
Currently (FW v1.6.3, libbladeRF v0.14.0m and bladeRF-cli v0.10.7 at the time of writing), the following information is stored in a user-modifiable "calibration region":
* FPGA size (40 or 115)
* [http://www.abracon.com/Oscillators/ASTX12_ASVTX12.pdf VCTCXO] (Voltage-controlled temperature-compensated oscillator) trim value

Unless you're planning to replace the FPGA ('''not''' a recommended endeavor), there's no reason to mess with this field. The reason the FPGA size is here rather than in the OTP region is largely historic and pertains to debug usage during early development and testing.

The VCTCXO frequency will drift over time and due to environmental factors. Users will generally want to periodically recalibrate this trim value, and write it back to the bladeRF.

== Backing up calibration data ==
From with the bladeRF-cli's interactive mode, the current calibration values can be viewed via the ''info'' command:

<pre>
bladeRF> info
  Serial #:                 00000000000000000000000000000000
  VCTCXO DAC calibration:   0xa0a8
  FPGA size:                40 KLE
  FPGA loaded:              no
  USB bus:                  4
  USB address:              2
  USB speed:                SuperSpeed
  Backend:                  libusb
  Instance:                 0
</pre>

Note the VCTXCO (trim) DAC calibration value above.

To back up this information to a file, which may later be restored through the bladeRF-cli program, the '''flash_backup''' command may be used.  Type <code>help flash_backup</code> to see the full help text for this command.

The general usage for saving calibration data is <code>flash_backup <output_file> cal</code>:

<pre>
bladeRF> flash_backup ~/Desktop/bladerf_cal_2014_03_18.bin cal
[INFO] Reading 0x00000100 bytes from address 0x00030000.
</pre>

This command will store the calibration data, along with some additional metadata, in the specified file. To view the associated metadata stored in the flash image, use the '''flash_image''' command.  This metadata may prove useful if you've accidentally renamed a file, or forgot which device (via serial number) is associated with the file.

<pre>
bladeRF> flash_image ~/Desktop/bladerf_cal_2014_03_18.bin

Checksum: d3ad936733b841cd10f0cb852d2a133e08cf080a60c4a607cca9908b75bd5e59
Image format version: 0.1.0

Image type: Calibration data
Address: 0x00030000
Length:  0x00000100
</pre>

== Restoring calibration data ==

=== From a a file ===
If you've backed up calibration data to a file via the '''flash_backup''' command, you can use the '''flash_restore''' command to write this data back to the device.  Note that the serial number information in the metadata is strictly for informational purposes; it '''is not''' used to prevent data from being written to another device.

For more information about the '''flash_restore''' command, run <code>help flash_restore</code>.

<pre>
bladeRF> flash_restore ~/Desktop/bladerf_cal_2014_03_18.bin 
[INFO] Reading 0x00010000 bytes from address 0x00030000.
[INFO] Erasing 0x00010000 bytes starting at address 0x00030000.
[INFO] Writing 0x00010000 bytes to address 0x00030000.
</pre>

'''Note:''' A power cycle will be required for this change to take effect.

== Wiped your calibration data? All is not lost! ==
If you've managed to wipe your calibration region and do not have the necessary tools to identify an appropriate VCTCXO trim value, email bladeRF@nuand.com with your serial number and a request to look up your factory-calibrated trim value.  (Please be patient!)

= Getting the most out of libtecla =
If you've built bladeRF-cli with support for [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/index.html libtecla] (<i>highly</i> recommended), you'll have a number of great features available to you, including history, tab-completion (for filenames) and handy key bindings (including emacs and vi bindings).

See the [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/tecla.html tecla man page] for detailed information about configuring and using libtelca-based programs.

To use vi or emacs key bindings, create a <code>~/.teclarc</code> file, and add the relevant line:
<pre>
edit-mode vi
</pre>
or
<pre>
edit-mode emacs
</pre>
