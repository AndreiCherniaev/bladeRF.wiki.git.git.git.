= Getting the most out of libtecla =
If you've built bladeRF-cli with support for [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/index.html libtecla] (<i>highly</i> recommended), you'll have a number of great features available to you, including history and handy key bindings (including emacs and vi bindings).

See the [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/tecla.html tecla man page] for detailed.

To use vi or emacs key bindings, create a <code>~/.teclarc</code> file, and add the relevant line:
<pre>
edit-mode vi
</pre>
or
<pre>
edit-mode emacs
</pre>
