* Add jumper to force FX3 into built-in bootloader ([http://nuand.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3072 workaround])
* Provide access to SPI flash through a header directly.  The MOSI and MISO are already brought out via the UART header.  Adding the CS and SCLK would allow direct programming of the FX3 SPI flash.
* FX3 debug LED is not very bright
* Align GPIF0-7 with DATA0-7.  Currently parallel programming of the FPGA via the FX3 required a weird mask translation.
* Add plugin style board to product line with switchable band pass filters for higher ham bands (70cm/23cm/33cm/13cm) similar to the filters on the XB-200.

* The order of the LEDs is incorrect. From left-to-right, they are actually: LED2, LED1, LED3. (The locations of LED1 (D11) and LED2 (D12) need to be swapped so the silkscreen labels read correctly).
