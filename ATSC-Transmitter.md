Broadcast television in the United States currently uses a set of standards developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee.  The digital ATSC standards replace the analog National Television System Committee (NTSC) standards for nearly all "major" broadcasters in the US and Canada.

In the typical deployment, ATSC broadcasts use 8VSB modulation in a 6 MHz channel to transmit a 19.39 Mbit/s MPEG Transport Stream, which contains a number of multiplexed video, audio, and data payloads.
