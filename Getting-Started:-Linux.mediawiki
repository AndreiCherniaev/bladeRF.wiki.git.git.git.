This guide describes the process of building and installing the bladeRF host libraries and tool for a Linux system, and quickly getting a device up and running using pre-built firmware and FPGA images.

'''Ubuntu users:''' 14.04 LTS (Trusty) is ''highly'' recommended. 

== Special note for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty) ==
The bladeRF host libraries and tools are actually included in Ubuntu now!  This is great!  However, the versions are somewhat out-of-date due to the lengthy release cycles for distributions:

<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli --version
0.9.0-0.9.0.15.8ba2499
$ bladeRF-cli --lib-version
0.10.0-0.9.0.15.8ba2499
</pre>

You can easily switch to [[ppa:bladerf/bladerf|https://launchpad.net/~bladerf/+archive/bladerf/+packages]] to get the latest release-grade bladeRF software:

<pre>$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bladerf/bladerf
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

This will install a newer libbladerf0, but will also uninstall the command-line tools due to a naming change.  To reinstall the tools, and install development headers:

<pre>$ sudo apt-get install bladerf libbladerf-dev</pre>

You can verify that you're running a recent release with:

<pre>$ bladeRF-cli --version
0.11.0-git-unknown
$ bladeRF-cli --lib-version
0.16.0-git-unknown
</pre>

'''Skip down to "Checking Basic Device Operation" after performing these steps.'''

== Easy installation for Ubuntu 13.10 and later ==
If you're running Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy) or later, a release PPA is available at [[ppa:bladerf/bladerf|https://launchpad.net/~bladerf/+archive/bladerf/+packages]].  New builds will appear occasionally as bladeRF releases are tagged.

Note: There is also a ppa:bladerf/bladerf-snapshots PPA for more frequent, bleeding-edge builds from master.

To activate this PPA,

<pre>$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bladerf/bladerf
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install bladerf</pre>

If you plan to build gnuradio, gr-osmosdr, etc, you will also need the header files:

<pre>$ sudo apt-get install libbladerf-dev</pre>

Then, skip down to the [[Getting-Started:-Linux#wiki-Checking_basic_device_operation|Checking basic device operation]] section, bypassing the compilation steps.

Note: This PPA replaces ppa:rtucker/bladerf-daily, which is now deprecated.

'''Skip down to "Checking Basic Device Operation" after performing these steps.'''

== Installing dependencies ==

'''If you already installed the bladeRF software using apt-get above, you can skip this section.'''

'''NOTE:''' If your distribution provides libusb-1.0 packages earlier than 1.0.16, you may want to consider to manually installing libusb >= 1.0.16, either from source or from upstream packages. Issues have been reported with earlier versions.

If your distribution does not provide a [[libtecla|http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla]] package (e.g., Fedora), it's recommended that you build it from source, as it makes the bladeRF-cli interactive mode much nicer to use!

=== Debian-based distros (e.g., Ubuntu) ===

Install dependent packages for the build:
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-1.0-0 build-essential cmake libncurses5-dev libtecla1 libtecla1-dev pkg-config git wget</pre>

You can check the libusb and libusb-dev versions installed on your system via:
<pre>
$ dpkg -s libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev 
</pre>

=== Redhat-based distros (e.g., Fedora, CentOS) ===
<pre>
$ sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
$ sudo yum install libusbx libusbx-devel cmake wget gcc-c++
</pre>

== Building bladeRF libraries and tools from source ==

'''If you already installed the bladeRF software using apt-get above, you can skip this section.'''

=== Clone the bladeRF git repository ===

To obtain the latest source code for the first time, clone the Nuand git repository via:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF.git ./bladeRF
$ cd ./bladeRF
$ ls  
</pre>


The directory contents will look something like this:
<pre>
CHANGELOG       CONTRIBUTORS  debian           fx3_firmware  host   README.md
CMakeLists.txt  COPYING       firmware_common  hdl           legal
</pre>

In the future, you can update the repository via:
<pre>
$ git pull
</pre>

=== Configure the build ===

First enter the directory containing the host source. Then create and enter a directory to perform the build in. By working out of the a 'build' directory, it's easy to later clean up, by simply removing 'build/'.

<pre>
$ cd host/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
</pre>


Next, configure the build. In the below example, we:
* Set up a Debug build
* Enable the installation of udev rules. 
** By default, this grants members of the ''plugdev'' group read-write access to bladeRF devices.  This group can can be changed via <code>-DBLADERF_GROUP=desired_group</code>. The remainder of this guide assumes the default. '''You should be sure to specify this group if plugdev is not used by your distribution.'''
* Specify that files should be installed into /usr/local
** You can install into a different location via the <code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/desired/path</code> option. Note that you'll need to need to configure binary and library search paths if you install elsewhere. If you're unsure how to do this, simply follow the steps below to use the default install location.

<pre>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON ../
</pre>


Ensure that your user is in the group specified by <code>BLADERF_GROUP</code>.  Check the output of the ''groups'' command:

<pre>
$ groups
jon adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
</pre>

In the above case, the user is already in the <code>plugdev</code> group, so we can skip ahead to the next subsection.

However, on other systems, the user may not already be in the required group. Furthermore, some distributions may not use the plugdev group. In these cases, you can either add a user to a more appropriate group or create a new group (and configure the build with <code>-DBLADERF_GROUP=desired_group</code>.  For example, to create a ''bladerf'' group and add the user ''jon'' to it:
<pre>
$ groups
jon wheel
$ sudo groupadd bladerf
$ sudo usermod -a -G bladerf jon

# Now log out and log back in...

$ groups
jon wheel bladerf
</pre>

=== Perform the build and installation ===

The following commands:
# Perform the build
# Install files to /usr/local or the location specified by <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>
# Updated share library paths, so that libbladeRF can be found

<pre>
$ make && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
</pre>

=== Uninstalling later ===
Note that from this same directory, you can run the following to uninstall the files place on your system in the previous step. <pre>sudo make uninstall</pre> 

The ''install_manifest.txt'' file, created after running the install step successfully, lists all the files installed.  It is a good idea to back up this file if you plan on removing this build directory later.

== Checking basic device operation ==

=== Detecting the bladeRF ===
With the libraries and tools installed, we can now use the ''bladeRF-cli'' (command line interface) to probe for devices attached to the system.

First, take a look at the command-line options:
<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli --help
</pre>

* If you see the help text, you can skip ahead to the invocation with the ''-p'' option.

* If you receive error about not being able to find libbladeRF.so.0, then we must create an ldconfig entry to ensure that library path in which libbladeRF was installed is searched. Follow the next few steps.
** As root (i.e., use sudo) create an /etc/ld.so.conf.d/bladeRF.conf and open it with your favorite editor
** Add a single line containing <code>/usr/local/lib</code> to the file.  If you specified something other than /usr/local for ''CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX'' (the default), adjust this line accordingly.
** Run <code>sudo ldconfig</code> and then try running <code>bladeRF-cli --help</code> again. The library search issue should now be resolved.


Note that the ''-p'' option may be used to probe for device. Plug in your device, and run the following command. You should see similar output.

<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -p
    Backend:        libusb
    Serial:         f12ce1037830a1b27f3ceeba1f521413
    USB Bus:        4
    USB Address:    8
</pre>

If you do not see any device listed:
* Verify that your user is in the ''plugdev'' group
* Double check ''dmesg'' and ''lsusb'' output
** The bladeRF's VID=1d50 and PID=6066
** If you see a Cypress device with VID=04b4 PID=00f3, then the bladeRF is running in the bootloader mode. No worries! Follow the instructions at [[Upgrading-bladeRF-firmware|this page]] to reflash your device.
* See the [[Troubleshooting]] page before continuing.

=== Viewing additional device information ===

More information about the attached device can be viewed while running ''bladeRF-cli'' in interactive mode. Enter this mode and issue the '''help''' command to see a list of available command.  Use the '''info''' command to print information about the device, and '''version''' to view version information, most notably, the firmware:

<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -i

bladeRF> help

... (Help text shown here ) ...

bladeRF> info

  Serial #:                 f12ce1037830a1b27f3ceeba1f521413                          
  VCTCXO DAC calibration:   0x894e
  FPGA size:                40 KLE
  FPGA loaded:              no
  USB bus:                  2
  USB address:              3
  USB speed:                Hi-Speed
  Backend:                  libusb
  Instance:                 0

bladeRF> version
  bladeRF-cli version:        0.6.0-git-f1f1c25
  libbladeRF version:         0.7.0-git-f1f1c25

  Firmware version:           1.0.0
  FPGA version:               Unknown (FPGA not loaded)

</pre>

Here we see the device's serial number, DAC calibration, FPGA information, and USB connection information.  Take note of the FPGA size, as this will help determine which FPGA file to load.

'''Note:''' If you see a warning about libbladeRF detecting outdated firmware, you should upgrade the firmware before continuing to the next section.  See [[Upgrading-bladeRF-firmware|this wiki page]] for more information.

=== Loading the FPGA ===
Support for loading the FPGA from flash automatically is currently supported and undergoing further testing. See the <code>bladeRF-cli --help</code> text for information on how to write an FPGA image to flash for autoloading.

For simplicity, this guide shows how to load the FPGA without storing it into flash for autoloading. (As a result, you'll have to load the FPGA each time the device is reset or plugged in.)

FPGA images can be obtained from [[the Nuand website|http://www.nuand.com/fpga]] or from a [[nightly build of "bleeding edge" images|http://hoopycat.com/bladerf_builds/]].

To load an image from the command line.
<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -l <path/to/fpga/file>
</pre>

Or to load an image while in interactive mode:
<pre>
bladeRF> load fpga <path/to/fpga/file>
</pre>

After the FPGA loads, you should see LEDs on the board begin blinking. At this point, you're ready to start using your device!

== Building GNU Radio and gr-osmosdr ==

The following procedure uses build-gnuradio to fetch dependencies and checkout some useful tools. However, it only covers installing GNU Radio and gr-osmosdr.  A similar procedure maybe used to install the other tools (such as gr-iqbal). 

A "sandbox" directory will be used to do the build. Change this to whatever your preferred build directory is in the relevant commands.

=== Using build-gnuradio to fetch dependencies and checkout source via Git ===

<pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/sandbox/gnuradio-builds
$ cd ~/sandbox/gnuradio-builds
$ wget http://www.sbrac.org/files/build-gnuradio
$ chmod +x ./build-gnuradio
$ ./build-gnuradio -m prereqs gitfetch
</pre>
Note that this takes quite a bit of time, depending on how many dependencies you need to have installed. Run <code>top</code> periodically to see what's currently going on.

=== Compile GNU Radio ===
<pre>
$ cd ~/sandbox/gnuradio-builds/gnuradio/
$ git checkout -b v3.7.3 v3.7.3
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/gnuradio-3.7.3  ../
$ make && sudo make install
</pre>


=== Add GNU Radio to linker path and executable path ===
Create a new file called /etc/profile.d/gnuradio.sh
<pre>sudo vi /etc/profile.d/gnuradio.sh</pre>

Put the following into it:
<pre>#!/bin/bash
# Add GNU Radio binaries to the search path
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gnuradio-3.7.3/bin
# Add GNU Radio python libraries to python search path
if [ $PYTHONPATH ]; then
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/gnuradio-3.7.3/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
else
        export PYTHONPATH=/opt/gnuradio-3.7.3/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
fi</pre>
'''Note: update the path above if you deviated from gnuradio-3.7.3'''

'''Note: If you're on a non-Debian based distro, you might need to replace "dist-packages" with "site-packages".'''

Again, with your favorite text editor, create a new file call /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnuradio.conf
you will need sudo for this again.. (one line file)
<pre>sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gnuradio.conf</pre>
Put this in the new file:
<pre>/opt/gnuradio-3.7.3/lib</pre>
'''Note: on some 64 bit systems, you might need a lib64 directory in this file as well.'''

* Update your library cache again
<pre>$ sudo ldconfig -v | grep gnuradio</pre>

You should see something akin to the following:
<pre>
/opt/gnuradio-3.7.3/lib:
        libgnuradio-fcd-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-fcd.so
        libgnuradio-blocks-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-blocks.so
        libgnuradio-pager-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-pager.so
        libgnuradio-audio-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-audio.so
        libgnuradio-wavelet-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-wavelet.so
        libgnuradio-trellis-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-trellis.so
        libgnuradio-wxgui-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-wxgui.so
        libgnuradio-digital-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-digital.so
        libgnuradio-qtgui-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-qtgui.so
        libgnuradio-filter-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-filter.so
        libgnuradio-noaa-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-noaa.so
        libgnuradio-channels-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-channels.so
        libgnuradio-video-sdl-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-video-sdl.so
        libgnuradio-pmt-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-pmt.so
        libgnuradio-atsc-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-atsc.so
        libgnuradio-analog-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-analog.so
        libgnuradio-vocoder-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-vocoder.so
        libgnuradio-fec-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-fec.so
        libgnuradio-fft-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-fft.so
        libgnuradio-runtime-3.7.3.so.0.0.0 -> libgnuradio-runtime.so
</pre>

If so, you're all set!

For the profile.d changes to take effect, either:
* Log out and log back in
* Run <code>$ source /etc/profile.d/gnuradio.sh</code> to update the environment in your current termunal
Once you have logged back in to your desktop, you should be able to run gnuradio-companion.


If you get a pop-up with errors about ''PYTHONPATH'' or ''LD_LIBRARY_PATH'', check the output of the <code>env</code> command to see how these environment variables are currently set.

=== Build and install gr-osmosdr ===
[http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/GrOsmoSDR gr-osmosdr] was checked out during the build-gnuradio execution. This provides GNU Radio support for a number of devices, including the bladeRF.

<pre>
$ cd ~/sandbox/gnuradio-builds/gr-osmosdr
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/gnuradio-3.7.3 ../
$ make && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
</pre>

=== Simple test applications to verify device operation ===
The osmocom programs may be used to quickly view an FFT and generate a tone. 

Test Receive: (446 MHz)
<pre>osmocom_fft -a bladerf=0,fpga=<your FPGA image> -s 2000000 -f 446000000</pre>

Test Transmit: (446 MHz + 25 KHz )
<pre>osmocom_siggen -a bladerf=0,fpga=<your FPGA image> -s 2000000 -f 446000000 -g 4 --sine -x 25000</pre>

Note that only one program can have the bladeRF opened at a time. 

If you'd like to run a quick test in a full-duplex configuration, consider creating a GRC flowgraph.  

''Do not connect the bladeRF TX output to the RX input without an attenuator.'' If you do not have an attenuator, consider using the bladeRF's (technically, the LMS6002D's) internal baseband and RF loopback modes, via the ''[http://git.osmocom.org/gr-osmosdr/commit/?id=751ad0f582423419f830e61f230c875cffaa1429 loopback=]'' argument to the osmocom sink/source block.
