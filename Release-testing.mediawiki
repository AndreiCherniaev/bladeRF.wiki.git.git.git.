This page is a collection of thoughts for required testing prior to cutting a release.

= FX3 firmware =
* Verify flashing with bladeRF-flash works on Windows, Linux, and OS X on USB 2.0 and USB 3.0
** Test both RAM-only path and flash paths.  This exercises recover, erase, reset, flash_firmware driver operations.
* Run both USB20CV and USB30CV in compliance testing mode to ensure there are no regressions
* Verify booting the FPGA via USB on Windows, Linux, and OS X on USB 2.0 and USB 3.0

= Library testing =
* Open and close device on USB 2.0 and USB 3.0
* Set/print all the different functions available in the library
* Loop over a peripheral access (eg: read all the LMS registers, then all the si5338 registers, repeat)
* Full duplex async repeater test at max sample rate

= FPGA testing =
* Self checking testbench for overflow/underflow conditions
* Self checking testbench for starting/stopping streams
* Self checking testbench for timed commands
