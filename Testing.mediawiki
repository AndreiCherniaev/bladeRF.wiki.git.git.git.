This page is a collection of thoughts for required testing prior to cutting a release.

= Library testing =
Run the libbladeRF regression test.

<source lang="bash">
cmake .. -DTEST_REGRESSION=TRUE
make -j`nproc` && sudo make install
make test_libbladeRF
</source>

= FPGA testing =
Run the HDL regression test. Please run the synthesis regression test if submitting PRs.

<source lang="bash">
cmake .. -DTEST_REGRESSION=TRUE
make -j`nproc` && sudo make install
make test_hdl
make test_synthesis # Only necessary for submitting HDL related PRs
</source>

= Release Testing =
Run the an all inclusive test. Note that this will take a while to run as it tests libbladeRF, HDL test benches, and HDL synthesis across bladeRF devices.

<source lang="bash">
cmake .. -DTEST_REGRESSION=TRUE
make -j`nproc` && sudo make install
make test_all
</source>

= FX3 firmware =
* Verify flashing with bladeRF-flash works on Windows, Linux, and OS X on USB 2.0 and USB 3.0
** Test both RAM-only path and flash paths.  This exercises recover, erase, reset, flash_firmware driver operations.
* Run both USB20CV and USB30CV in compliance testing mode to ensure there are no regressions
* Verify booting the FPGA via USB on Windows, Linux, and OS X on USB 2.0 and USB 3.0
