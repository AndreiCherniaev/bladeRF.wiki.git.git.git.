This is a revolving list of tasks that we need to do.  Priorities change constantly.

= Current Items =

== Unassigned ==
* Figure out why linux has a bandwidth allocation issue after a ^c from a program
* In-band scheduling support
* Discipline VCTCXO using 1pps from GPSDO
* Discipline VCTCXO using 10MHz external reference
* Parse NMEA messages from GPS in FPGA for timestamping
* Add ability to 'reset on next 1pps' signal for TX/RX sample synchronization
* Fix or remove FS USB descriptors.

== bpadalino ==
* Automatic IQ Calibration
* Create and simulate HDL models
* Create signal generator block for FPGA

== jynik ==
* Developing test and release cycle plans on the wiki. Needs to cover versioning & tagging schemes, branch usage, and tests required to pass before version release **at a minimum**. litghost as opened and issue and provided [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/issues/105 some initial ideas].
* Create coding style & patch/pull request guidelines document
* Create a BUGS/Getting Help document detailing information to gather and provide when posting issues to the forum or IRC
* Embedded sweeping spectrum analyzer demo based upon fosphor
** Pending on FPGA FFT block

= Future Items =
* Si5338 MIMO/Expansion clock settings
* Create impulse latency RTT mode for FPGA
* TX -> RX Loopback mode in HDL
