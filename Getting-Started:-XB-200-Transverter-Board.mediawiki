This page provides an overview of the <b>XB-200and provides some information on its use.

= Introduction =

The <b>XB-200 transverter board</b> is a block up-down converter that expands the bladeRFâ€™s lower frequency range, allowing the bladeRF to be used in HF/VHF applications. 

The RX and TX paths each have a set of 3 filters, at the 50MHz-54MHz (6 meter) band, 149MHz-159MHz (2 meter) band, and 206-235MHz bands. There are also pairs of SMA connectors that will let users plug their own band filters into the RF path.

The XB-200 mates to the bladeRF as follows. (There is only one possible orientation)
* XB-200 <b>U20</b> to bladeRF <b>U74</b>
* XB-200 <b>J5</b> to bladeRF <b>J61</b>
* XB-200 <b>J6</b> to bladeRF <b>J60</b>
