This page is intended to track the status of bladeRF software reported on various Linux distributions. Note that the bladeRF developers do not manually verify all of these reports, so "your mileage may vary."

We could use some help in automatically testing distribution support for regressions (nightly, if possible). Please email bladeRF@nuand.com or hop on IRC if you're interested!

Please feel free to update this page as needed, but please test [https://github.com/nuand/bladerf/tree/master master] before changing entries if you find that support is broken.  If you find that support on distribution is broken, be sure to [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/issues/new file a bug on the issue tracker].
