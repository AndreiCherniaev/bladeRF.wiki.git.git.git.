This page is intended to track the status of bladeRF software on various Linux distributions.

We could use some help in automatically gathering this information (nightly, if possible). Please email bladeRF@nuand.com or hop on IRC if you're interested!

Please feel free to update this page as needed, but please test [https://github.com/nuand/bladerf/tree/master master] before changing entries.  If you find that support on distribution is broken, be sure to [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/issues/new file a bug on the issue tracker].
