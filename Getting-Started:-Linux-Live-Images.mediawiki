This page provides some information and links to Live Linux DVDs or USB images that include bladeRF support.  

This is a great place to start if you are new to Linux, and is a better choice than using a virtual machine for a few reasons:
* SDR support and applications are pre-installed
* All of your CPU and RAM are dedicated to the OS, rather than splitting between a guest and host.
* It's very portable!
** You can often create persistent data region on live USB sticks to save your changes to the image
* The quality and reliability of USB pass-through support varies across different VM software offerings.

= Creating Live DVDs and USB Sticks =
There are a myriad of useful resources regarding burning ISOs to DVDs and preparing bootable USB sticks on the web. Below are a just a few guides. Feel free to add any guides you've found helpful!

** You may need to run the following to install the Startup Disk Creator: <pre>$ sudo apt-get install usb-creator-gtk</pre> 
** Note the option to reserve extra space . This allows you to make persistent changes to the image, for example, installing your favorite packages or program configurations. <b> This is highly recommended!</b>

= Live Distros =

Below are live Linux images that contain bladeRF support.

The FPGA images are included in <code>/usr/share/Nuand/bladeRF</code> and will be [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/wiki/FPGA-Autoloading#host-software-based automatically loaded] when a device is opened.  If you wish to use different FPGA images, you can place them in <code>~/.config/Nuand/bladeRF/</code>.
