This page provides an overview of the <b>XB-200and provides some information on its use.

= Introduction =

The <b>XB-200 transverter board</b> is a block up-down converter that expands the bladeRF’s lower frequency range, allowing the bladeRF to be used in HF/VHF applications. 

The RX and TX paths each have a set of 3 filters, at the 50MHz-54MHz (6 meter) band, 149MHz-159MHz (2 meter) band, and 206-235MHz (includes 1.25m) bands. There are also pairs of SMA connectors that will let users plug their own band filters into the RF path.

The XB-200 mates to the top of the bladeRF as follows. (There is only one possible orientation)
* XB-200 <b>U20</b> to bladeRF <b>U74</b>
* XB-200 <b>J5</b> to bladeRF <b>J61</b>
* XB-200 <b>J6</b> to bladeRF <b>J60</b>

= Hardware =

== Architecture ==

The transverter was meant to extend the range of the bladeRF without impairing the current frequency capabilities.  As such, the transverter has a bypass path as well as a mixed path.  The bypass path just connects the antenna port to the IF port directly without any modification to the signal.

The mixed path first has a filterbank for selectivity filtering.  This filterbank consists of 4 separate paths: 50MHz filter, 144MHz filter, 222MHz filter and a custom filter.  The custom filter can be put in line using the filter SMA connections on the transverter.

Each of the filters was designed to try to notch the terrestrial FM band as much as possible.  To be able to receive normal FM, the simplest way is to put an SMA jumper in the custom path (i.e., between the RX/TX <b>FILT</b> and <b>FILT-ANT</b> SMA connectors).

The block converter stage uses an ADF4351 to produce a 1248MHz high-side injection tone.  The mixing frequency was chosen because of it being about 3x higher than the 300MHz highest frequency we want to use and we can run the ADF4351 in integer-N mode, reducing spurs which may have resulted from a fractional-N mode of operation.  The output of the ADF4351 is always divided by 2x, so 38.4MHz*32.5 = 1248MHz.

Since high side injection is used, the LMS6002D on the bladeRF is tuning to 1248MHz - (desired frequency).  Moreover, there is a spectral inversion that is occurring due to the choice of high-side injection.  The LMS6002D is programmed to swap I and Q on the data bus being presented to the FPGA to correct for the flip.

== SMA Connectors ==

There are 10 SMA connectors on the XB-200. Below are brief descriptions of each.

<u>RX</u> 
* <b>RXIF</b> (<i>J3</i>): RX Intermediate Frequency. Connect this to the bladeRF RX port (<i>J53</i>) via an SMA cable.
* <b>RXANT</b> (<i>J12</i>): RX Input. Connect an antenna here.
* <b>RXFILT</b> (<i>J8</i>): Mixer-side of the RX custom filter path. Connect this directly to <b>RXFILT-ANT</b> to use no filter, or connect this to one end of your custom filter, and the other end of your filter to <b>RXFILT-ANT</b>.
* <b>RXFILT-ANT</b> (<i>J9</i>): Antenna-side of the RX custom filter path.
* <b>ADC</b> (<i>J14</i>): This SMA exposes the direct ADC sampling path (skipping the LMS6002). This can also be accessed without the XB-200 via <i>J61</i> on the bladeRF.

<u>TX</u>
* <b>TXIF</b> (<i>J1</i>): TX Intermediate Frequency. Connect this to the bladeRF TX port (<i>J54</i>) via an SMA cable.
* <b>TXANT</b> (<i>J2</i>): TX output. Connect an antenna here. When not transmitting, it is recommended to keep a dummy load or attenuator on this port.
* <b>TXFILT</b> (<i>J11</i>): Mixer-side of the TX custom filter path. Connect this directly to <b>TXFILT-ANT</b> to use no filter, or connect this to one end of your custom filter, and the other end of your filter to <b>TXFILT-ANT</b>.
* <b>TXFILT-ANT</b> (<i>J10</i>): Antenna-side of the TX custom filter path.
* <b>DAC</b> (<i>J15</i>): This SMA exposes the DAC direct sampling path (skipping the LMS6002). This can also be accessed without the XB-200 via <i>J60</i> on the bladeRF.

== GPIO ports ==

GPIO pins are exposed on the XB-200 via <b>J1</b>, <b>J13</b>, and <b>J16</b>.
