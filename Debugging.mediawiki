This page provides tips on debugging various portions of the bladeRF code base. 

If you suspect you've encountered a bug that hasn't been reported yet, it is generally very helpful to include results of some preliminary debugging to an [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open issue tracker] item, [http://nuand.com/forums/ forum] post, or question on IRC. When reporting bugs, developers and community members may ask you to provide additional information, using some of the techniques described here.

= Host-side tools and libraries =

== Configuring a Debug Build ==
In most cases, one will want to ensure debug symbols are enabled while debugging. This can be enabled by setting the CMake <i>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</i> variable to <b>Debug</b>: 

<code>$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../</code>

GCC/GDB users will likely want to include as much debug information as possible. Use <i>ENABLE_GDB_EXTENSIONS</i> to compile with <b>-ggdb3</b>: 

<code>$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_GDB_EXTENSIONS=Yes ../</code>

== Crashes and Memory-related Failures ==
When dealing with a crashing application, one generally wants to identify:
# The state of the application at the time the failure occurred, including what the program was currently executing, and the state of relevant variables.
# The origin of any incorrect values, such as when a pointer was assigned a NULL value.

=== A note on debugging with GNU Radio === 
When possible, try to reproduce failures with the bladeRF-cli or a simple test applications to remove some degree of complexity from the situation, as well as narrow the scope of where defects reside.

If this is not possible, or the failure appears to be associated with the gr-osmosdr bladeRF support, it is recommended that you review the [http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/TutorialsDebugging#Tutorial-Using-gdb-with-Pythonic-GR-applications GNU Radio documentation on debugging with gdb] first.

== Getting a backtrace in GDB ==
To quote the [http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Backtrace.html GDB documentation], <i>A backtrace is a summary of how your program got to where it is.</i>  Backtraces in GDB show the current stack frame followed by the calling stack frames.

The below examples shows a snippet from a simple debug session of the bladeRF-cli, where an invalid loop bound defect was introduced to result in a segfault. In this example, we collect a backtrace and inspect the state of a function 2 stack frames prior to location where the segfault occurred. 

We first start by running the program (bladeRF-cli, in this case) in GDB.  Note that we tell GDB to interpret the arguments following the program name as arguments to that program, rather than to gdb, via <b>--args</b>.

<pre>
$ gdb --args bladeRF-cli -p

</pre>

Upon running the program, we see it terminate (crash) with a segmentation fault. Note that the location and name of the function that the crash occurred in is shown here -- this is an important piece of information to include an your findings.  

If the function that the program has crashed in is called from many places in the code, one many not be able to glean much from this information. 

The <b>backtrace</b> or <b>bt</b> command may be used to display the currently executing function and its callers. Here we can see the path of function calls taken, as well as the arguments to each function call, with line numbers.

<pre>
(gdb) bt

</pre>

From the above backtrace, we can see how we got to the <i>libusb_get_device_descriptor()</i>.  Note that in frame #1, <i>lusb_device_is_bladerf()</i> was called with a NULL argument, which is suspicious.  To figure out why a NULL pointer was passed to this function, we'll need to inspect the state of the program in stack frame #2, inside <i>lusb_probe()</i>

The <b>frame</b> or <b>f</b> command may be used to select and print a stack frame:

<pre>
(gdb) frame 2
#2  0x00007ffff7bd349c in lusb_probe (info_list=0x7fffffffe210)
    at /home/jon/projects/bladeRF/host/libraries/libbladeRF/src/backend/libusb.c:2003
2003            if( lusb_device_is_bladerf(list[i]) ) {
</pre>

Now we can take a look at the state of the local variables in this function, and print out some additional information:

<pre>
(gdb) info local
status = 0
i = 13
n = 0
count = 13
list = 0x618ef0
info = {backend = BLADERF_BACKEND_LIBUSB, 
  serial = "0000000004BE", '\000' <repeats 16 times>, "\320\341\377\377\377", 
  usb_bus = 2 '\002', usb_addr = 4 '\004', instance = 4156353024}
context = 0x618840
(gdb) print list[13]
$2 = (libusb_device *) 0x0
(gdb) print list[12]
$3 = (libusb_device *) 0x61a1c0
(gdb) 
</pre>

In this code, we see that a <i>count</i> local variable is 13. This is <i>supposed</i> to be used as an upper bound of a loop. However, we see that the variable <i>i</i> is 13, causing us to access an invalid list element. (The valid elements are in list[0] through list[12]).
