This page provides tips on debugging various portions of the bladeRF code base. If you suspect you've encountered a bug that hasn't been reported yet, it is generally very helpful to include results of some preliminary debugging to an [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open issue tracker] item, [http://nuand.com/forums/ forum] post, or question on IRC.

== Configuring a Debug Build ==
In most cases, one will want to ensure debug symbols are enabled while debugging. This can be enabled by setting the CMake <i>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</i> variable to <b>Debug</b>: 

<code>$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../</code>

GCC/GDB users will likely want to include as much debug information as possible. Use <i>ENABLE_GDB_EXTENSIONS</i> to compile with <b>-ggdb3</b>: 

<code>$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_GDB_EXTENSIONS=Yes ../</code>
