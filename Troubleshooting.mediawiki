= FPGA Fails to load =
There are a few different reasons for this.  One might be that the wrong size FPGA image is being used for the FPGA on your board.  Check to make sure you are using the 40kLE FPGA for x40 and the 115kLE FPGA for x115.

If you compile your library as Debug, and see it is still timing out, check `dmesg` to see if there is anything out of the ordinary - like no room on an ep ring.  This is a known issue in Ubuntu 12.04 with a 3.2 linux kernel.  The only known solution, so far, is to update to a newer kernel either through a distribution update or `sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-quantal`.

If you are using a Virtual Machine, there have been issues reported when changing the interfaces or claiming different interfaces.  The level of success has been varied depending on the type of port (XHCI or EHCI) and the VM software used.  We are currently working on native Windows support to help remedy the VM situation.


= libbladeRF does not compile =
If you see:

    backend/libusb.c:263:5: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘libusb_get_version’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    backend/libusb.c:264:5: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type

during compilation you have an old version of libusb and should probably upgrade! Get the latest version from http://libusbx.org/

= Mac OSX Superspeed issues =

If you've used ports to get libusb installed, there is a high likelihood that it is version 1.0.9.  Unfortunately, libusb didn't add superspeed support until version 1.0.15 for OSX.  We've had reports that the absolute latest version of libusb, 1.0.17, works on OSX.  Please update accordingly.

= CLI gives a legacy mode warning =

This warning comes up if you have a [firmware](FX3-Firmware) that is considered out-of-date and requires flashing.  Please update to the [http://nuand.com/fx3/latest.img latest firmware] using the `bladeRF-flash` or `bladeRF-cli` tool.

Before asking questions, please ensure you have the following information available.  This will help expedite the process.
* Your hardware
** Are you running on a 32-bit or 64-bit processor
** What is your USB controller? Given that USB3 is still moderately new, some controllers have found to perform significantly better (or worse) than others.
** Is this a tablet or smartphone?
* The OS you're using
** For Linux, know your kernel version and distribution.
