= Failing to see or connect to the device =

== Device may only be opened by one program ==
Currently, only one program may have a device open at a time. Any additional calls to bladerf_open() or bladerf_open_with_devinfo() will fail with BLADERF_ERR_NODEV.

Under the hood, this is due to the first caller opening a device claiming the device's interfaces via libusb_claim_interface().  Further attempts to claim an interface will fail with LIBUSB_ERROR_BUSY.

Setting the libbladeRF log level to DEBUG or VERBOSE will generally make this issue apparent. See the bladeRF-cli -v option, or libbladeRF's bladerf_log_set_verbosity() function for information on setting the log level.

For example, if a first instance of the bladeRF-cli is started:
<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -i -v verbose
bladeRF> info
  Serial #:                 00000000000000000000000000000000
  VCTCXO DAC calibration:   0x8100
  FPGA size:                40 KLE
  FPGA loaded:              yes
  USB bus:                  2
  USB address:              6
  USB speed:                Hi-Speed
  Backend:                  libusb
  Instance:                 0
</pre>

If another instance of the CLI is run simultaneously, we'll see the aforementioned libusb error about a device being busy (as its interfaces are already claimed by a different device handle.):
<pre>
$ bladeRF-cli -i -v verbose                                       ~
[VERBOSE] Found a bladeRF
[DEBUG] FPGA currently does not have a version number.
[DEBUG] Could not claim interface 0 - LIBUSB_ERROR_BUSY
No device(s) attached.
bladeRF> 
</pre>

If you're encountering the following error message with GNU Radio programs, but have verified that the device operates in the CLI, double check that no other programs have the device open:

<code>FATAL: bladerf_source_c failed to open bladeRF device libusb:instance=0</code>


== Device's VID and PID ==
Under normal operation, the bladeRF should appear with VID=1d50 and PID=6066.  

If you see a Cypress device with VID=04b4 and PID=00f3, your bladeRF's FX3 may be in its bootloader mode. In this case, you may see a message in the bladeRF-cli program that notes a potential bladeRF running in bootloader mode. See the [[Upgrading-bladeRF-firmware|firmware upgrade]] wiki page for information on flashing the device.

== Virtual Machines ==
If you are using a Virtual Machine, there have been issues reported when changing the interfaces or claiming different interfaces.  The level of success has been varied depending on the type of port (XHCI or EHCI) and the VM software used.  

It has been reported that some VM software does not fully support USB 3.0. Verify the speed that the VM detects the device at, and try falling back to 2.0 if 3.0 does not work.

== Windows ==
To see the device in Windows, ensure you have the appropriate <code>inf</code> installed so that Windows associated the bladeRF with a libusbK driver. Verify that you've followed [[Getting-Started:-Windows#installing-libusbx|these steps]] in the Getting Started guide for Windows.

Windows driver signing enforcement may cause driver installation problems. Try using the latest Zadig on the computer you want to install the driver on. Zadig will self-sign the driver package and install the corresponding certificate.

In Windows 8, Libusbx may incorrectly report USB 3.0 SuperSpeed connection as Hi-Speed.

== Mac OSX ==
If you have performed an operating system update, and a previously working bladeRF stops working, you might have a mismatch between the OS and libusb. (For example moving from OSX 10.9.0 to 10.9.1). A sign of this will be that you can see the device via <code>bladeRF-cli -p</code>, but you cannot send or receive any data and instead you will see error messages like <code>[ERROR] could not access peripheral</code>. In this case, reinstall libusb:

<code>
sudo port -f uninstall libusb
sudo port install libusb
</code>

== Host or Device-specific Issues ==
As USB 3.0 is still relatively new, we've heard reports of some controller working great, and others not working at all. Ensure you have the latest drivers (and firmware, if needed) for your USB controller.

If possible, try testing the device on both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports, as well as other host machines. 

=== Issues with XHCI and Linux ===
There is currently a known problem with Intel XHCI controllers in Linux, where killing an application using libbladeRF (which uses libusb) in a manner that doesn't allow libusb_close() to be called. The symptoms will include kernel crashes with NULL pointer dereferences in xhci_free_dev(), and "not enough bandwidth for altsetting...) messages in dmesg (requiring a Power-on Reset).

To avoid this issue, ensure that programs using the device are closed cleanly:
- Add SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers to your custom applications to ensure the bladeRF device handle is closed. See the [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/blob/master/host/utilities/bladeRF-cli/src/interactive/fgets.c#L40 bladeRF-cli] source for a reference.
- When using GNU Radio Companion, **do not** click the "Kill flowgraph" (a red X) button. Instead, close the GUI window associated with the flow graph. If your flow graph doesn't contain any GUI widgets, you'll have to add a dummy one just to achieve this.

As always, any help into investigating this issue is appreciated!

= FPGA fails to load =
In many cases, load failures have been the result of trying to load the wrong size FPGA image for the board in question. Check to make sure you are using the 40kLE FPGA for x40 and the 115kLE FPGA for x115.

If you're unsure which FPGA size is on your board, identify the the Altera Cyclone IV package on the top of the bladeRF. You should see text on the package that reads ''EP4CExxxF23C8N'', where ''xxx'' is the size -- either 40 or 115.

= Configuration and Compilation Issues =

== Build fails due to a warning being treated as an error ==
By default, builds use ''-Werror'' or ''/WX'' to treat warnings as errors, with the intent of forcing developers to address any warnings.

Occasionally, we've seen different compiler versions throw errors that were not seen on developers' machines, breaking master for users.

Master is intended to always build. If you suspect a build is broken due to a warning being treated as an error, please report it via IRC or the issue tracker, and run the following from your build directory as a temporary workaround:
```
cmake -DTREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=No ../
```

== libbladeRF ==

=== Missing libusb ===
If the libusb is reported to not be found, it may be the case that pkgconfig was not able to locate libusb. (This will certainly be the case for Windows.) Check your PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable, and ensure that libusb is installed to a location in your system's library search path. 

Users that are in a *nix environment and have installed libusb via a package manager, should double check that both the library and development packages for libusb-1.0 (sometimes packaged as libusbx-1.0) are installed.

Windows users should use the '''LIBUSB_PATH''' CMake variable to specify the location of a the libusb(x) binary distribution.

=== Outdated libusb ===
If you receive a message similar to the following when running CMake, you'll need to obtain a more recent version of libusb:
<pre>
A newer libusb version is needed by libbladeRF. libusb >= v1.0.10 is required to build. libusb >= v1.0.16 is recommended.
</pre>

For some distributions, it may be possible to simply pull in a package from an upstream source for a later distro version.  However, this is not always possible, as more recent versions of libusb packages may require a newer libc or libudev. 

For example, Ubuntu 12.04 users will find that libusb-1.0.9 is provided in the repositories. In this case, it is recommended to upgrade to a more recent distribution (a 3.8+ kernel is also highly desirable). If this is not possible, these users may want to try obtaining a libusb package from the 12.10 repositories (this has not been tested), or attempt to build a slightly newer version from source.

=== libusb_get_version() is undefined ===
''Note: This build issue has been resolved as of [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/commit/95a6c1d0e0988196b57205bff38a47251f0692b4 commit 95a6c1d0e098]. If you see this issue, ensure that you've checkout out the lastest codebase, remove and recreate your build directory, and re-run CMake.''

If you see an error about being unable to find the <code>libusb_get_version</code> function, the version of libusb installed on your machine needs to be updated. Updating to >= 1.0.10 for Linux is required, but >= 1.0.16 is '''highly''' suggested.

There is [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/issues/130 an open action item] to change the CMake configuration to detect and complain about this, prior to compilation.

== bladeRF-flash ==

=== libusb hotplug support ===
If you obtain a warning about the installed libusb version not containing hotplug support, you'll need a newer libusb version to build bladeRF-flash. See [[Troubleshooting#outdated-libusb|Outdated libusb]]

== Cannot build <code>libtecla</code> under Mac OSX 10.9 due to missing <code>libgcc.a</code> ==
Please take a look at [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/wiki/Building-libtecla#configure-and-build Building libtecla] and note the <code>sed</code> script required to remove the link to <code>libgcc.a</code> in the Makefile.  This is due to the fact that the <code>configure</code> script for <code>libtecla</code> uses <code>gcc -print-libgcc-file-name</code>, which [http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmbugs/2013-February/027238.html does not provide a full-path].

Removing all notion of <code>libgcc.a</code> from the <code>Makefile</code> appears to alleviate the problem. Alternatively, one may be able to replace this item with the full path the the clang-provided libgcc.a.

= Mac OSX Superspeed issues =

If you've used ports to get libusb installed, there is a high likelihood that it is version 1.0.9.  Unfortunately, libusb didn't add superspeed support until version 1.0.15 for OSX.  We've had reports that the absolute latest version of libusb, 1.0.17, works on OSX.  Please update accordingly.

= Legacy mode warning =

This warning comes up if you have a that is considered out-of-date and requires flashing.  

Please update to the [http://nuand.com/fx3/latest.img latest firmware], per the instructions in [[Upgrading-bladeRF-firmware|this wiki page.]]
