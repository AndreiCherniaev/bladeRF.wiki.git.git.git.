This page provides some quick tips on troubleshooting problems.

If you run across an issue not listed here and find a solution, please feel free to post it here!

= Failing to see or connect to the device =
If you are using a Virtual Machine, there have been issues reported when changing the interfaces or claiming different interfaces.  The level of success has been varied depending on the type of port (XHCI or EHCI) and the VM software used.  We are currently working on native Windows support to help remedy the VM situation.

= FPGA fails to load =
In many cases, load failures have been the result of trying to load the wrong size FPGA image for the board in question. Check to make sure you are using the 40kLE FPGA for x40 and the 115kLE FPGA for x115.

If you're unsure which FPGA size is on your board, identify the the Altera Cyclone IV package on the top of the bladeRF. You should see text on the package that reads ''EP4CExxxF23C8N'', where ''xxx'' is the size -- either 40 or 115.

= libbladeRF does not compile =
If you see:

    backend/libusb.c:263:5: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘libusb_get_version’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    backend/libusb.c:264:5: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type

during compilation you have an old version of libusb and should probably upgrade! Get the latest version from http://libusbx.org/

= Mac OSX Superspeed issues =

If you've used ports to get libusb installed, there is a high likelihood that it is version 1.0.9.  Unfortunately, libusb didn't add superspeed support until version 1.0.15 for OSX.  We've had reports that the absolute latest version of libusb, 1.0.17, works on OSX.  Please update accordingly.

= CLI gives a legacy mode warning =

This warning comes up if you have a [firmware](FX3-Firmware) that is considered out-of-date and requires flashing.  Please update to the [http://nuand.com/fx3/latest.img latest firmware] using the `bladeRF-flash` or `bladeRF-cli` tool.

Folks in the community are generally very happy to help. However, to make the most of everyone's time, please try to have as much of following information available as you can. Providing this information up front can help you get to the bottom of things much quicker.

* Information about the target host machine
** Are you running on a 32-bit or 64-bit processor?
** What is your USB controller? Given that USB3 is still moderately new, some controllers have found to perform significantly better (or worse) than others.
** Are you connecting your device to a 2.0 or 3.0 port? If a 3.0 port, is it connecting 
** Is this a tablet or smartphone?
* The OS you're using
** For Linux, please note your distribution (and that distribution's version), as well as kernel version
* Version information for the items you're having issues with
** When running the bladeRF-cli in interactive mode (<code>bladeRF-cli -i</code>), the <code>version</code> command may be used to display information for both host items and the attached device. This is generally helpful in identifying if a problem you're seeing has been fixed in more recent versions.
* Any relevant error messages or warnings.
** Run the bladeRF-cli with <code>-v verbose</code> to enable all output
** (Linux users) Check the output of dmesg and lsusb
** For GNU Radio and gr-osmosdr issues, note the versions of these you're running.
* Have you followed the steps in the [[Home#getting-started-guides|Getting Started]] guides?
** If you're currently in the process of following these guides, which steps have you already performed, and at which step are you encountering problems with?
