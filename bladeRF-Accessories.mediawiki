= External DC Power =
The DC barrel jack on the bladeRF requires a 5&nbsp;V adapter, which should be rated to supply at least 1.5&nbsp;A. Many supplies will experience significant voltage droop as the current draw approaches as little as 50% of the rated maximum. If the voltage droops too low, it will degrade the performance of the bladeRF.

When selecting a power supply, look for a load current / output voltage plot. For best results, the voltage should remain above 4.5 V at the expected current draw. If such a plot is not available, it is advisable to choose a supply with more output current to compensate. The recommended OMNIHIL supply can source 3&nbsp;A, which is more than enough for any application. It is also a medical-grade supply and the voltage droop occurs much closer to the rated maximum current draw compared to typical power supplies with similar specifications.

== bladeRF2-micro ==

Shown on page&nbsp;17 of the [http://www.nuand.com/bladeRF-micro.pdf schematic], the bladeRF-micro features a TPS2115A power multiplexer that will automatically select the appropriate voltage source. If 5&nbsp;V is present on the DC power jack, the power mux will select the DC jack as the voltage source. Otherwise, it will use the 5&nbsp;V from the USB host. If using, it is recommended to insert and power the DC jack first, followed by the USB plug.

= Attenuators and Terminators =

You should never transmit without a 50&nbsp;ohm load attached to the bladeRF's TX port, whether it be an antenna or a terminator. The same goes for the outputs on the XB-200.  

Similarly, you should not connect the bladeRF TX port directly to the RX port. If you'd like to externally loop TX into RX, a 30&nbsp;dB attenuator is recommended.

= RF Test Enclosures =

An RF test enclosure is an excellent way to perform testing without causing interference. Use of a well-shielded test enclosure is ''highly'' recommended.
