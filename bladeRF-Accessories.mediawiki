This page lists some recommended accessories for the bladeRF.  Please feel free to add your favorites!

= External DC Power =
The DC barrel jack on the bladeRF requires a 5V adapter, which should be rated to supply 1.5 to 2A.

The inner plug on the receptacle (on the bladeRF) is 2.5 mm and is +V.  The diameter of the plug on the power supply is 5.5mm and is -V.

As shown by page 14 on the [http://nuand.com/bladerf.pdf bladeRF schematic], the DC barrel jack is a  [http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/393/rapc712x_cd-371318.pdf Switchcraft RAPC712X]. Remember that both jumpers on J70 need to be moved when switching between USB power and the DC barrel input.

= Attenuators and Terminators =

You should never transmit without a 50 ohm load attached to the bladeRF's TX port, whether it be an antenna or a terminator. The same goes for the outputs on the XB-200.  

Similarly, you should not connect the bladeRF TX port directly to the RX port. If you'd like to externally loop TX into RX, a 30 dB attenuator is recommended.

= RF Test Enclosures =

An RF test enclosure is an excellent way to perform testing without causing interference. Use of a well-shielded test enclosure is ''highly'' recommended. (Unless, of course, you enjoy paying large fines to the FCC.)
