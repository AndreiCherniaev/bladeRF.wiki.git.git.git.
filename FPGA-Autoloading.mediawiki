= Overview = 
There are currently two ways to have the FPGA automatically loaded when you begin using the bladeRF: a host-software based mechanism, and a firmware-based mechanism.

These "autoload" mechanisms alleviate the need to manually load the FPGA via the bladeRF-cli or using the <code>bladerf_load_fpga()</code> function.

= Host software-based =
As of version [https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/commit/14f515e4674674fb818172cde5feb9733cfaedcc 0.16.0], libbladeRF provides a mechanism to load an FPGA when a device handle is opened, if the FPGA is detected to not already be in a configured state.

<i>This approach is generally recommended over the firmware-based mechanism for users who will always be using the bladeRF device with a host machine.</i>

Upon opening a device handle, libbladeRF checks the device's FPGA size.  It then searchs for the corresponding FPGA bitfile (<code>hostedx40.rbf</code> or <code>hostedx115.rbf</code>) in one of the following locations. The order in which these locations are searched is from top to bottom.

<b>Linux or OSX</b>
* <code>your_home_directory/.config/Nuand/bladeRF/</code>
* <code>your_home_directory/.Nuand/bladeRF/</code>
* <code>/etc/Nuand/bladeRF/</code>
* <code>/usr/share/Nuand/bladeRF/</code>

The user's home directory is determined based upon contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code>.

<b>Windows</b>
* <code>%APPDATA%/Nuand/bladeRF/</code>

Simply place (or symlink, for *nix users) the FPGA bitfile in one of these directories and it will be loaded when you first open the device handle.

= Firmware-based =

Another option is to write an FPGA-bitstream to the device's SPI flash.  When the firmware boots, it checks for the presence of FPGA metadata, and will begin to load the FPGA if a bitstream is present. 

This process is slower than the host-based mechanism mentioned above. However, this mechanism allows for "headless" (without a host PC) operation. It takes approximately 10 seconds to load an x40 image, and 30 seconds to load an x115 image.  Speeding this process up is a pending development task.

<b>Important:</b> Be sure that the firmware autoload has completed before attempting to use the device (i.e., open a device handle)! When the FPGA is fully configured, LEDs 1-3 will be lit.

The FPGA may be written to the bladeRF's SPI flash via the CLI:
<pre>bladeRF-cli -L path/to/hostedx(size).rbf</pre>

To disable this autoload mechanism, erase the FPGA image and metadata. This can also be done via the CLI:
<pre>bladeRF-cli -L X</pre>

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> It is highly recommended that you disable FPGA autoload when prior to upgrading device firmware in order to avoid any potential conflicts.
